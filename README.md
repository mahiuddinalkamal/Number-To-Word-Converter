# NumberToWordConverter
A tool written in WPF consuming a WCF service to convert any number (European standard) to words. The service can be freely used with other applications too.

1. The client will be found in NumberToWordCurrencyConverter folder.
2. The service can be hosted in many ways, here I chose a simple console application to host the service. 
3. The solution file will be found in NumberToWordConverterService folder.
4. Please open the service solution in visual studio with ADMIN privilege otherwise Host will be blocked.
5. Run both solutions and enjoy the conversion.

Please feel free to let me know if any corner cases missed out. Also, any suggestion regarding the overall improvement or architecture is welcome. Thanks!
